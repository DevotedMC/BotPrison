# BotPrison

Sends certain players to a prison dimention and prevents them from moving or taking any non-chat/command action.

Basically, this allows player chat bots that can't be exploited easily.

## Commands

* /bpreload -- Reloads the config file.
* /bpadd /bpa -- Add a player as a bot.
* /bpremove /bpr -- Removes a player as a bot and sends them to natural spawn.
* /bpadduuid /bpau /bpremoveuuid /bpru -- Like /bpadd and /bpremove, but use UUID's instead.
